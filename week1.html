	<h2 id="successful"> A Review on Vogue.com </h2>
		<p>
		
		<a href="http://www.vogue.com">On a daily basis,</a> I truly go through about 15 different websites per average day. One that I look at every day is vogue.com. It is where I get my daily update on what is happening in the fashion industry and pop culture around me. I believe they are very successful at how they built their site and the strategies they chose to use. The learnability is very straight forward, even as an avid user. For example, if I was curious about New York Fashion Week and what collections were being debuted or how the collections looked like, I could simply click on the “runway” option on the main menu bar and the first feed that is displayed is the most recent collection for Spring 2018 Ready-to-Wear (which is what is starting to be debuted at NYFW this week).  </p>
		
	
		<p>Following this text of learnability, the rate at which this was done and can be done again at is quite efficiently. They have the same process for anytime of the year and is always arrange by what is most relevant, along with optional drop down menus of what else there is to view. This applies equally to the way one will remember how to get to this same area (along with any other topic of the site). If one were to click on a slideshow of photos that were taken to show each model on the runway wearing the collection and then were to go back and decide to look at another collection it would simple go back over the photos you went to look at previously, or one could exit the slideshow and be back at the page where they described in detail what the collection was focused on. Overall I believe they have a very pleasing aesthetic and it encompasses what Vogue is branded as meanwhile still staying young and contemporary with the world today in technology as they put more and more focus onto their site every year.</p>

	<h2 id="less-successful">A Review on Nytimes.com</h2>	
	    <p>
	  
	    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">To compare this magazine publishing based company to another,</a>  which decided to as well focus more on stories being posting on their online site, I would have to contrast it with nytimes.com. Although they are a newspaper which is not quite the same as a magazine (as they involve a great deal of more text than a fashion magazine), I still find that the way they have laid out their website to show each article is extremely overwhelming and not pleasing to the eye.  </p>
	  
		<p>The NY Times has kept a consistent aesthetic, however, they lack the fluidity that I found on vogue.com so appealing and attractive which I would have to say is the reason I enjoy begin a frequent visitor on their site. They have over 15 main bar page options and they each can be interconnected with one another so I always have a hard time trying to find the right topics I would like to read about or spend so much time going through each to then just forget the original reason that I went on the site for. All of these flaws contrast against the five quality components that I felt were reached in vogue.com's site. </p>
