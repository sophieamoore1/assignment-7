	<h1 id="assignment-2"> Sophie Moore's Portfolio Website Layout</h1>
	<section>
	
	<h2 id="purpose"> What is the purpose of the website?</h2>
		<p>
		For my website, I would like to achieve great impressions amongst future employers who chance across my LinkedIn page or my resume, where they could find the link to my site. Hopefully attain a job or internship through them appreciating my aesthetic and detailed eye, as well as my accomplishments.  </p>
        
	<h2 id="audience"> Who is the intended audience?</h2>
		<p>My portfolio is aimed for potential employers as well as any peers that would like to hire me to assist in any projects or advice they would like from me.</p>
	
   <h2 id="content"> What tone do you want for the siteâ€™s written content?</h2>
		<p>The site will be professional but not formal per se. I would like one to be able to see my work and projects in an organized fashion and still understand the minimal aesthetic I use. I will have my resume on their as well as a personal background on myself.  </p>
        
	<h2 id="primary"> What will be the primary content of your site?</h2>
		<p>On the landing page of my site, I would have my name and logo (for myself) as the header along with a small description of what one will find as they navigate the site. Pages would include: About me, Resume, Work, and Contact me. </p>      
        
	<h2 id="secondary"> What will be the secondary content?</h2>
		<p>About me would have an image of myself alongside a paragraph or information on my personal background. Resume would be an image of my resume uploaded and an option to download it. Work would pull down a series of options to look at, such as school projects, personal projects, or internship projects, where then each option would entail jpegs of my work done under each area. Contact me would be an area where one can find my email address and phone number.  </p>   
        
    <h2 id="navigate"> How will users navigate through your site?</h2>
		<p>Users will be able to navigate my site by using the different page options and my logo as a way to go back to the homepage. It will be simple and straight forward. If one scrolls down on the homepage, however, it will lead into the fist page tab, About me, and as you scroll further down it will continue to go to each page option, going left to right until Contact me. It will be signified that you are doing so as each page take will look as if it was selected.   </p>
